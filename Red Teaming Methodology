🛡️ 5. Red Teaming
🔥 What Is Red Teaming?
Red Teaming is a full-scope, simulated cyberattack designed to test how well an organization can detect, respond to, and defend against real-world threats. Unlike traditional penetration testing (which is often technical and short-term), red teaming is more strategic and stealthy—mimicking actual adversaries.

Think of the red team as the "ethical attackers" trying to break in, while the blue team (the client's security) tries to stop them.

🧠 Purpose of Red Teaming
Test detection and response, not just vulnerabilities.

Simulate Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)—like real-world hackers.

Go beyond tools and test people, processes, and technology.

🧩 How You Can Offer Red Teaming Services
🚩 1. Scoping & Planning
Start with defining:

The goals (e.g., test SOC effectiveness, bypass MFA, reach crown jewels).

Rules of Engagement (ROE): What’s off-limits? Are blue teams aware?

Testing window and stealth level (noisy or covert?).

🧾 Deliverable: Red Team Plan & ROE document

🧨 2. Reconnaissance (OSINT)
Gather intel on the target—like a real hacker would.

✅ You Collect:
Employee names (LinkedIn, social media)

Email formats (for phishing)

Subdomains, IP ranges, leaked credentials

Technologies in use (CMS, VPNs, cloud providers)

🛠️ Tools: Maltego, Recon-ng, Google Dorks, Shodan

🕵️‍♂️ 3. Initial Access & Exploitation
Try to gain access through:

Phishing campaigns (custom-crafted emails)

Exploiting vulnerable web apps

Credential stuffing or password spraying

Dropping payloads (via USB drops or malicious documents)

🛠️ Tools: Cobalt Strike, Gophish, Metasploit, Evilginx, custom scripts

📡 4. Post-Exploitation & Lateral Movement
Once inside, act like an attacker would:

Dump credentials (Mimikatz)

Escalate privileges

Move laterally through the network

Try to access "crown jewels" (e.g., databases, internal systems)

🛠️ Tools: BloodHound, Empire, Rubeus, SharpHound

🔐 5. Evasion & Persistence
Test the client’s detection capabilities:

Use obfuscated payloads

Evade EDR/AV tools

Establish persistence (e.g., startup scripts, scheduled tasks)

📝 6. Reporting & Debrief
Give a full breakdown of:

How you got in

What you accessed

Which defenses failed or succeeded

Gaps in detection, response, or escalation

🧾 Deliverable: Red Team Report + attack chain diagram + risk scoring + recommendations

🔁 Optional: Conduct a blue team debrief (purple team mode), to improve defenses.

🔄 7. Purple Team Engagement (Optional)
Work alongside the client’s security team to improve detection and response in real time—turning red team findings into learning moments.
