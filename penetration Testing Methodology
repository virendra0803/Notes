🔐 2. Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing (VAPT)
🔍 1. Scoping & Planning
Before testing, meet with the client to define:

What is in-scope (networks, apps, cloud, APIs, IoT, etc.).

Whether testing is black-box, grey-box, or white-box.

Test schedule (to avoid business disruption).

Obtain proper authorization in writing (very important!).

🧾 Deliverable: Signed scope of work + testing agreement.

🔦 2. Vulnerability Assessment (VA)
This part identifies known vulnerabilities in the environment.

✅ What You Do:
Run automated vulnerability scans on:

Networks (internal and external)

Web apps

Endpoints

Databases

Look for outdated software, missing patches, misconfigurations, etc.

🛠️ Tools:

Nessus, OpenVAS, Qualys, Burp Suite (for web apps)

Nikto, Nmap, and custom scripts

🧾 Deliverable: A list of identified vulnerabilities with severity levels (Low–Critical).

🎯 3. Penetration Testing (PT)
Here, you actively exploit vulnerabilities (ethically) to simulate real-world attacks.

✅ What You Do:
Try to access unauthorized systems or data.

Test firewall bypass, privilege escalation, password cracking, etc.

Perform lateral movement once inside a system.

🛠️ Tools:

Metasploit, Burp Suite Pro, Hydra, John the Ripper, SQLmap

Manual testing for logic flaws and privilege escalation

🧾 Deliverable: Documented proof-of-concepts (PoCs) showing how vulnerabilities were exploited.

🧾 4. Reporting & Recommendations
Create a comprehensive VAPT Report that includes:

Executive summary (for non-technical stakeholders)

Technical details (CVEs, screenshots, exploitation steps)

Risk ratings (CVSS scores)

Remediation guidance for each finding

🧾 Deliverables:

Final VAPT report (PDF or doc)

Remediation roadmap (prioritized list)

Option for a retesting session after fixes

🤝 5. Post-Engagement Support
Help the client understand and fix issues.

Offer retesting to verify if vulnerabilities are resolved.

Optionally propose ongoing managed security or quarterly VAPT.
