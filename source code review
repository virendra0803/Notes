👨‍💻 6. Source Code Review
🔎 What Is It?
Source Code Review is the process of analyzing application code for security vulnerabilities, logic flaws, or insecure coding practices. It can be done manually or with automated tools, and it helps catch issues before they make it to production.

It’s like VAPT—but instead of testing the app from the outside, you look directly into its source code.

🎯 Why It’s Important
Detect insecure functions and business logic flaws.

Find hidden backdoors, hardcoded secrets, and poor crypto.

Uncover vulnerabilities missed by scanners (like insecure authorization).

Prevent data breaches and strengthen SDLC.

🧩 How You Can Offer Source Code Review Services
🗂️ 1. Scoping & Access
Start by working with the client to define:

What application(s) to review (web, mobile, APIs, microservices).

What languages/tech stacks are used (Python, JavaScript, Java, PHP, etc.).

How code will be shared (Git repo access, code zip, on-site review).

🧾 Deliverable: Review plan, NDA if required, secure access protocol

🔍 2. Manual and Automated Code Analysis
✅ Manual Review:
Analyze code for OWASP Top 10 risks:

Injections (SQL, LDAP, OS)

Broken authentication

Insecure direct object references (IDOR)

Insecure cryptography

Review access control logic, input validation, error handling

Focus on security-sensitive areas: auth flows, payment systems, file uploads

🛠️ Tools: Manual inspection + secure coding checklists

✅ Automated Scanning:
Run static code analysis (SAST) tools to catch common bugs and insecure patterns.

🛠️ Tools:

SonarQube, Semgrep, Fortify, Checkmarx, Bandit (Python), Brakeman (Ruby), ESLint (JS)

🔐 3. Secrets & Config Review
Check for hardcoded passwords, API keys, tokens.

Inspect .env, config files, and deployment scripts.

Validate use of environment variables, secure storage practices.

🧾 4. Reporting & Recommendations
Build a detailed report that includes:

List of vulnerabilities with risk ratings (High, Medium, Low)

Code snippets showing the issue

Recommended secure coding fixes

Links to best practices (e.g., OWASP Cheat Sheets)

🧾 Deliverables:

Secure Code Review Report (PDF/HTML)

Fix recommendation guide

Optional: walkthrough call with developers

🔁 5. Developer Training (Optional)
Offer follow-up sessions to train the client’s developers:

Secure coding best practices

How to use linters and SAST tools

How to fix common bugs
